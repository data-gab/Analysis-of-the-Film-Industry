    "To make big impact in this industry, I would suggest Microsoft to make films belonging to the lowest scored genres. While it is a risk, if the movie are high quality, the fans will receive them very well since they are usually disappointed with these genres. The top scoring genres do not seem to me that they reach all audiences, however, it is easier to reach all audiences in the lower rated categories."

    "\n",
    "The covariance between worldwide gross vs movie production budget is positive meaning the direction of their relationship is postive. The correlation between worldwide gross vs movie production budget is 0.748306, which is higher than the correlation between domestic gross vs movie production budget. This shows that a change in worldwide gross with change movie production budget in a similar way.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "The correlation obtained for domestic gross and movie production budject was lower than the correlation obtained for worldwide gross and movie production budget. This suggests that international audiences are more interested in movies with higher budgets. Higher movie budgets mean that movie studios can hire A-list actors, have quality graphics, writers, directors, producters etc. This makes sense since A list actors, directors, etc. are more likely to be known worldwide. That being said, a higher budget movie allows for a better film crew and actors, therefore, it is best for Microsoft to have a large movie budget so that they can get a large return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at domestic gross and worldwide gross, their correlation was 0.938853, which demostrates a very high correlation. This means that if a movie does well domestically, it will most likely do well internationally. The opposite as well is true. If a movie does not do well domestically, the same will be for the international gross. In order for Microsoft to succeed in the film industry, they should focus on how domestic audiences will receive a film and they should consider releasing their movies abroad to make the most money."

The top 5 film studios are Buena Vista Studios, 20th Century Fox Studios, Warner Bros Studios, Universal Studios, and Sony Studios. Buenva Vista Studios are best known for creating many of the Walt Disney films and Marvel Comics movies. Twenth Century Fox Studios have created some of the most well known films such as Titanic, the Home Alone series, Ice Age series, Cast Away, Avatar, etc. Warner Bros. Studios are known for popular films as the Harry Potter Series, The Shining, The Matrix, Space Jam, DC Comics films, etc. Universal Studios has created many famous movies like the Jurassic Park series, the Fast and Furious series, Jaws, Shrek Series, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "The most successful movies studios produce a majority of animation and action films. Buena Vista studio films produce mainly animation films so they perform the best. Animation films can appeal to audiences of all ages since generally they have a G or PG rating. Twenth Century Fox Studios produce some animation, but they also produce a lot of action films. Something that the top 5 film studios all have in common is that they all have very famous movie series'.\n",

    "For Microsoft to succeed in this competitive industry, it would be most beneficial for them to produce animation and action movies. As well as finding good writers and producers to create a movie series that will be loved by audiences. A good movie series makes sure that audiences will return again for the sequel.\n"
